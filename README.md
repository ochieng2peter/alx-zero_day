#The First Probation week
A lot is going on and I'm still here, still learning and still hope to do more.
For this markdown, I have just learnt that there's more to it than I though initially and a clear guide is at: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
Let's see how many times I'm able to come back at this checkout that link.


##You should know by all means that this README has not followed any of the guides neither does it tell you anything about this project.
The reason for this would be; because I also don't know the scope of this project as of yet, maybe it's just to learn git or maybe it's the beginning of more to come!
